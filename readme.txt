Email users with pending drafts.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to remind users about their unattended draft posts. Yes, it includes all of John's ideas, plus more.

* Send emails on a daily or weekly schedule at your preferred time
* Check for draft pages as well as posts, if desired. Or just pages, if that's your preference. No judgment here
* Target drafts that were created beyond a specified time period or haven't been updated for a while
* Each email will display the number of drafts along with a reminder for each one
* Optional feature to prevent the plugin from being deactivated (helping you resist the temptation to ignore the drafts)
* Debug features to verify what's being sent
